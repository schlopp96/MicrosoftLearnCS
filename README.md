This is my personal repository containing my progress, class notes, and other information in relation to the Microsoft Learn online C# course & its resources.

## Structure of Course Files

- Lesson Paths (LPs) are the highest level in the file structure of the course sections.

  - They contain further files, called Modules, which then contain individual lessons.

- Modules are most similar to Chapters.

  - These organize the specific chapters that go over in-depth material.

- Finally, there are the individual lesson folders.
  - All data inside these folders is what makes up the actual C#/.NET projects and their source code.
