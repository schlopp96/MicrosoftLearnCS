## Structure of Course Files

- **Lesson Paths** (LPs) are the highest level in the file structure of the course sections.

  - They contain further files, called **Modules**, which finally contain individual **lessons**.

- **Modules** are most similar to Chapters.

  - These organize the specific chapters that go over in-depth material.

- Finally, **Lessons** contain the actual individual lesson files.

  - All data inside these folders is what makes up the actual C#/.NET projects and their source code.

- Example of file path to:

  - **Lesson Path 3** _(Working with Data)_ **Module 1** _(Correct Data Types)_ **Lesson 2** _(Floating Point Types)_:

  `~\MicrosoftLearnC#\LP3_WorkingWithData\01_CorrectDataTypes\FloatingPointTypes`
