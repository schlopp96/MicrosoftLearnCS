## Structure of Course Files

1. **Lesson Paths** (LPs) are the highest level in the file structure of the course sections.

2. **Modules** contain the individual **lessons** and their code files.
    - **Modules** are most similar to chapters in a book.
      - These organize the specific unit lessons that go over relevant course material.

3. **Lessons**, which contain the actual project files/source code.
    - All data inside these folders is what makes up the actual C#/.NET projects and their source code.

- For example, here's how one would find the second lesson of the first module within LP3:

  - **Lesson Path 3** _(Working with Data)_ **Module 1** _(Correct Data Types)_ **Lesson 2** _(Floating Point Types)_:
    - `~\MicrosoftLearnC#\LP3_WorkingWithData\01_CorrectDataTypes\FloatingPointTypes`
