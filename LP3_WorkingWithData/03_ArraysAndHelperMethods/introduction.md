# Introduction

## What are Arrays?

- C# arrays allow you to store sequences of values in a single data structure.
- Once you have data in an array, you can manipulate the order and the contents of the array.
- Furthermore, you can perform powerful string operations using array helper methods.

- In this module, you'll use several helper methods to sort the data or reverse the order of the data. You'll clear out the items in the array and you can resize the array to add new items. You'll convert a string into an array by splitting it into smaller strings each time you encounter a character like a comma. You'll also split a string into an array of characters. Finally, you'll join all of the elements of an array into a single string.
