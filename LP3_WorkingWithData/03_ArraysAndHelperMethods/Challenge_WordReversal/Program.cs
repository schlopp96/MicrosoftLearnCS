/*
        % Word Reversal Challenge %

< Write the code necessary to reverse the letters of each word in place and display the result.
< In other words, don't just reverse every letter in the variable pangram.
< Instead, you'll need to:
    > reverse just the letters in each word
    > print the reversed word in its original position in the message.

! START WITH THIS CODE:
    ? string pangram = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";

^ If you're successful, you should see the following output:
    ~ "ehT kciuq nworb xof spmuj revo eht yzal god"



*/
string pangram = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
Console.WriteLine($"\nOriginal Pangram: {pangram}\n");
